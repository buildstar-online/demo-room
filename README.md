# Demo Room

A space for playing with real-time global-illumination in Unity3D.

- 3D environement w/ colliders
- HDRP lighting setup w/ light and reflection probes
- Hacky UI for controlling the post processing and scene lights

> Relies on enlighten which Unity is dericating and as of the last update has not published a new solution, its been years so im assuming theyre just waiting for ray-tracing to be the norm.
